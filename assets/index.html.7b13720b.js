The goal is: even if we know nothing about relatively low-level network principles like TCP/IP, RESTful, and RPC, or service governance topics like service registration and discovery, fault detection, and complex load balancing, and we only know how to write CRUD code, we can still develop robust programs or services before the delivery date. But we couldn&#39;t find tools or frameworks that met this goal.</li><li>In the early days of my programming career, I was a full-time front-end development engineer. I know what kind of backend API support the front-end needs. Through research, I chose the <code>OpenAPI 3.0</code> (aka <code>swagger v3</code>) interface description specification as a bridge for front-end and back-end collaboration. I want to provide front-end members not only with online documentation but also a mock server that can generate fake data.</li><li>Although there are quite a few learning materials about Protobuf syntax and best practices available online, we still feel the learning curve is quite steep. We need a technical solution for gRPC that both newcomers and veterans can quickly pick up and use.</li></ul><h4 id="result" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#result" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Result</h4><p><code>go-doudou</code> was released.
